# Useful-functions
## Super useful functions and tools, can copy and paste directly into R markdown file 

Really helpful for Social Scientists who just want to make manuscripts and it not be a extremely painful experience. 
Full disclosure, I am NOT a data scientist. But I am a scientist who has discovered all the amazingness that is R for writing manuscripts. 
These functions will help make tables, specifically demographic tables quickly and efficiently. 
I am still learning, but hopefully my learning process will be able to help others who want to take part in R, but really just want to get manuscripts out the door and out of their way. 
Suggestions are welcome!
